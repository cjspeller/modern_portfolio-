        <p>Hello, my name is Cartrell Speller. I am currently a senior (Fall 2020 Grad) at North Carolina A&T State University majoring in
          Information Technology. I am pursing a career interest in web development, user interface design, and or graphic design. I currently 
          have experience working with Java, Python, HTML/CSS, Photoshop CS, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and many other applications. Below 
          are descriptions that should better explain my experience regarding my career interest and provide a better understanding of my skill set.

      <div class="job job-1">
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Currently with web development I have created and assisted with the creation of websites. I originally worked with low-level development 
          and now transition into creating responsive webpages. This portfolio you are currently viewing was created by me and was done so with the 
          implementation of HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>UI Design is a conceptual interest I have. I enjoy the thought process and the mock up process when it comes to creating an interface. 
          I want to assist in developing designs that makes technology easier to pick up and understand even while itâ€™s steadily advancing. My 
          current experience with UI Design is the mock up design I created for my own app called "ChaTunes". ChaTunes is a texting application 
          that allows users to communicate with each other using song lyrics. Currently I only have mock ups on how the interface would work 
          when users interact with. This was just a creative idea I had that seemed like fun & is very innovative.  
        </p> 
      </div>

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
        <p>Graphic Design is a self-taught skill set that I have been working on for the past 5 years now. This interest originated when I created 
          my own YouTube channel and wanted to create my own thumbnail and banner art. This interest then transition into a hobby and is now a side 
          job of mines. Currently I am a freelance Graphic Designer that does commissions for content creators, whether that is thumbnails or banners, 
          as well as create logos, advertisements, and business cards for up incoming businesses.
